Library Management system


I have designed a Library Management System where admin can Perform CRUD(Create,Retrive,Update,Delete)Operations. and student can view the list of the books

1.home_view:-
    For the welcome page home_view function is created where index.html file is rendered.
2.adminclick_view--
    this function is used to define the page after admin successfully loggedin and if not it will asked to signup or login
3.adminsignup_view--
    this function allowes to create new admin
4.is_admin--
    checks admin has logged in or not
5.afterlogin_view--
    render the html page which will show once admin has logged in and also shows the function admin can do
6.Following functions are defined for the operations admin can perform
    1.addbook_view
    2.viewbook_view
    3.updatebook
    4.deletebook
7.studentbook_view --
    this function lets the student see the books list in library without any login
